# 📘 TechBridge

**TechBridge** is a platform that bridges the gap between engineering students and real-world software development experience. It connects fresh graduates and B.Tech students with real client projects, enabling them to **earn while they learn**, build **verified portfolios**, and gain **practical experience** that leads to job placements.
